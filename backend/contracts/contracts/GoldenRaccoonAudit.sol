/// @dev This contract records *who may act*, *what policy they act under*, and

///      there is no `payable` function, no token approval, no transfer, and no

///      Authorization model
///      -------------------
///      Every user is their own admin. A user authorizes an agent under a policy
///      hash and an expiry. The agent may then log decisions and record execution
///      intents for that user, and nothing else. A user can revoke instantly, and
///      an authorization that has passed its expiry is inert without any
///      revocation transaction.
///
///      Replay and staleness
///      --------------------
///      An execution intent is identified by a caller-supplied `intentId`, which
///      is consumed on first use. A second use of the same id reverts. Each
///      intent also carries `expiresAt`, and recording after that timestamp
///      reverts, so a signed-but-unsubmitted plan cannot be revived later.
///
///      This interface is the implementation of the V2 audit layer described in
///      issue #16. Until that specification is formally approved the surface here
///      should be treated as proposed, and `VERSION` bumped on any change.
