          Two runs of the same check rarely agree exactly, and the interesting question is which part moved. This aligns two
          saved runs by agent and by finding — not by position, so a reordered list is not reported as wholesale change — and
          shows what differs in the inputs, the observations, the recommendation and the provider coverage behind them. It
          reports what changed and declines to say why: a saved record does not contain that, and a score that moved while
          sources went dark is two facts, not one explanation. Nothing is re-run, no provider is called and no record is
          changed.
