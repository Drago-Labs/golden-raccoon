# V3 External Audit Checklist

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Issue | Drago-Labs/golden-raccoon#31 |
| Companion spec | `docs/V3_CONTRACT_SPEC.md` |
| Companion test matrix | `docs/V3_CONTRACT_TEST_MATRIX.md` |
| Companion upgrade/recovery analysis | `docs/V3_UPGRADE_RECOVERY.md` |
| Status | Audit-ready. This checklist is the deliverable that the external auditor uses to verify the V3 contracts. Each item must be checked off with a test reference or a code reference. |

This checklist is organized by the threats in `docs/V3_CONTRACT_SPEC.md` §8 and the acceptance criteria in §10. The auditor checks each item against the implementation and marks it ✅ (pass), ❌ (fail), or N/A (not applicable).

| 1.3 | The Soroban contract has no token transfer / swap / approve methods. | Spec §6.3, T-SOR-071 | |
| 1.4 | The Soroban contract never invokes another contract. | Spec §6.3, T-SOR-074 | |
| 1.5 | No `selfdestruct` opcode is reachable in the EVM contract. | T-EVM-068 | |
| 1.6 | No `private` storage holds a private key or secret. | T-EVM-065, T-SOR-072 | |
| 1.7 | Pause does not move funds (no `Transfer` event on pause). | T-EVM-066, T-SOR-073 | |

## Auditor notes

- The auditor should verify that the implementation matches the interface in `docs/V3_CONTRACT_SPEC.md` §5 and §6 exactly.
- The auditor should run the full test matrix in `docs/V3_CONTRACT_TEST_MATRIX.md` against the implementation.
- The auditor should confirm that no new external calls, token interfaces, or `selfdestruct` opcodes are introduced in the implementation.
- The auditor should confirm that the upgrade path (UUPS proxy / versioned WASM) is correctly implemented and that the timelock is enforced.
- The auditor should confirm that the daily limit, trade percent, slippage, price impact, and asset allow/block enforcement are correctly implemented and cannot be bypassed.
