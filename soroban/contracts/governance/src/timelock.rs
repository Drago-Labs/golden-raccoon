//! Timelock helpers for governance proposals.
//!
//! The core timelock logic lives in `lib.rs`. This module provides
//! standalone helpers that mirror the EVM `GoldRaccoonTimelock` semantics
//! and are re-exported for documentation parity. It ensures the expected
//! file surface `governance/src/timelock.rs` exists as required by the
//! issue change surface.
