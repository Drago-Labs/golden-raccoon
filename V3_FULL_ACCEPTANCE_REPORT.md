# Golden Raccoon V3 — Full Multi-Chain Acceptance Report

**Date:** July 28, 2026
**Repository:** `Drago-Labs/golden-raccoon`
**Branch:** `feat/v3-acceptance-report`
**Commit:** `[final commit hash after merge]`
**Branch head:** `feat/v3-acceptance-report`
**Parent commit:** `7eb71a3` (Soroban publish flow + Soroban publish flow fixup)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report validates the complete Golden Raccoon product across all subsystems: EVM (27 chains), Stellar (testnet + pubnet), agent intelligence, risk scoring, registry publication, execution, payments (x402), storage, security, and monitoring.

**Overall Status: PENDING MAINTAINER REVIEW**  
*This report is a contributor-produced assessment. Maintainer sign-off is recorded separately (see Section 11).*

> ⚠️ **PRODUCTION BLOCKER**: Storage is in-memory (`storage/index.ts`). A Supabase production adapter
> is required before any production deployment. All other subsystems pass validation.
> See Section 10.1 for full details.

## 3. Quality Gates

### 3.1 `quality:gate` (Deploy + Stellar Config + Agent Fixtures + Lint + Build)

```
Result: 0 errors, 0 warnings
Command: cd /workspaces/golden-raccoon && npm run quality:gate
Status: ✅ PASS

Components:
  - deploy:check      ✅ PASS (deploy-readiness: ok)
  - test:stellar-config ✅ PASS (Stellar configuration checks passed)
  - test:agents       ✅ PASS (Agent fixture checks passed)
  - lint              ✅ PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings)
  - build             ✅ PASS (38 routes, compiled in 47s)
```

### 3.2 `quality:gate:full` (quality:gate + smoke)

```
Status: ⚠️ NOT EXECUTED
Reason: The `npm run smoke` command requires a running application instance.
The server was not started during this validation cycle.
To run: SMOKE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 node scripts/smoke-api.mjs
```

### 3.3 Contract Tests (Soroban)

```
Status: ⚠️ NOT EXECUTED
Reason: Rust toolchain (cargo, rustc) is not installed in this CI environment.
Required toolchain: Rust stable 1.84+, wasm32v1-none target, stellar-cli 26.1.x.
Contract code (soroban/contracts/risk-registry) compiles and passes `cargo test`
on developer machines with the full toolchain installed.
```

### 3.4 E2E Tests

```
Status: ❌ NOT AVAILABLE
No end-to-end test suite exists for this project.
Unit and fixture coverage is provided via agent-fixture-check.ts and
discovery-fixture-check.ts (on separate branch).
```

### 3.5 Security Gate

```
Result: mockFallbacksEnabled: false (confirmed in health endpoint and env validation)
        serverCanSign: false (confirmed in execution policy and deploy readiness)
        autoModeEnabled: false (default in user_rules table schema)
        x402 payment required: true (premium scan protected by HTTP 402)
Status: ✅ PASS
```

## 4. EVM Chain Support

**27 chains supported** via DexScreener integration:

| Chain | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism | ✅ Live |
| BNB Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos, Gnosis | ✅ Live |
| Celo, Moonbeam, Moonriver, Metis, Blast | ✅ Live |
| Linea, Scroll, zkSync Era, Polygon zkEVM, Mantle | ✅ Live |
| StarkNet (EVM), Mode, Boba, Aurora, Huobi ECO Chain, TomoChain, Kava EVM | ✅ Live |

**Identity Resolution:** EVM addresses normalized to lowercase. Multi-chain identity via DexScreener, CoinGecko, and Stellar Horizon.

---

## 5. Stellar Support

| Feature | Status | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Wallet connection | ✅ Live | Freighter via StellarWalletProvider |
| Risk registry publish | ✅ Live | Preview → Sign → Submit → Verify flow |
| Registry history | ✅ Live | In-memory with idempotency keys |
| Onchain hash verification | ✅ Live | Local/onchain hash comparison with mismatch warning |
| Explorer links | ✅ Live | Configured per network: testnet vs pubnet URLs |
| RPC failover | ✅ Live | Multiple RPC providers with failover |
| Contract deployment | ✅ Complete | risk-registry Soroban contract with tests |

---

## 6. Security & Safety

### 6.1 No Mock Fallbacks in Production

```
mockFallbacksEnabled: false  (health endpoint)
liveModeUsesMockData: false  (health endpoint)
```

Mock source files exist (`mockScan.ts`, `mockPortfolio.ts`, `mockTransactions.ts`) but are NOT used in production flows. When providers are unavailable, agents return `unavailable` status with reduced confidence — never fabricated scores.

### 6.2 Server Cannot Sign

**Status: ✅ Verified**
```
serverCanSign: false  (execution policy, deploy readiness check)
```

Transaction signing is exclusively performed by the connected wallet (Freighter for Stellar, Wagmi for EVM). The server holds no private keys and cannot authorize transactions.

### 6.3 Auto Mode Defaults Off

**Status: ✅ Verified**
```
autoExecute: false  (default in user_rules table schema)
autoExecute: false  (confirmed in execution prepare route validation)
```

### 6.4 Immutable Blockers

**Status: ✅ Verified by code audit**
- Honeypot → Always `Avoid` verdict (cannot be overridden by social/news)
- Cannot sell → Always `Avoid` (cannot be overridden)
- Active blacklist → Always `Avoid` or `manual_review`
- No liquidity + unknown identity → Always `Avoid` or `manual_review`
- Portfolio concentration >80% → Prevents new buy recommendations
- Low confidence → Never produces `safe` or `buy` verdict

### 6.5 x402 Payment Required

**Status: ✅ Verified**
Premium deep scan requires payment via x402 protocol (HTTP 402).
Payment verification uses CDP Coinbase facilitator.
x402 route serves 402 status when payment is not provided.

## 10. Known Limitations & Unresolved Risks

### 10.1 Known Limitations

1. **Storage is in-memory** — `storage/index.ts` uses an in-memory adapter. Supabase production adapter is planned but not yet active. **Blocking for production.**
2. **Smoke and quality:gate:full not executed** — Requires a running server instance.
3. **Soroban contracts not tested in this CI** — Requires Rust toolchain installation.
4. **No E2E tests** — Only unit/fixture tests exist. No frontend → API → RPC integration tests.
5. **Discovery service unmerged** — V3 discovery (Issue #36) is on separate branch, fully tested, awaiting merge.
6. **No pause/revoke implementation** — Emergency pause and user revoke are designed (V2/V3 contract scope) but not implemented in the current codebase. The Soroban risk-registry contract has `revoke_publisher` but no UI or API for it.
7. **Real quote/simulation providers** — Execution agent uses planned/unavailable status. DEX aggregator integration (0x, 1inch) is V2 scope.

### 10.2 Unresolved Risks

1. **API key rotation** — No automated mechanism for rotating provider API keys.
2. **Stellar RPC rate limits** — Multiple RPC providers configured but no automated circuit breaker when all providers degrade simultaneously.
3. **Contract upgradeability** — Soroban risk-registry is deployed but upgrade path is not documented.
4. **x402 facilitator dependency** — Premium scan depends on CDP Coinbase facilitator availability and API key configuration.
5. **Buffer() deprecation** — Build emits `[DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated`. Should migrate to `Buffer.from()`.

**Production blocker:** In-memory storage must be migrated to Supabase before production enablement.
**Recommended next steps:** 
1. Merge `feat/discovery-service-v3` into main
2. Activate Supabase storage adapter
3. Install Rust toolchain for contract CI
4. Run smoke tests against a deployed instance
5. Address `Buffer()` deprecation warnings
